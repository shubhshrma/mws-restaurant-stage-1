# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course Project - Stage 3
---

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I  took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to create a seamless offline experience for users. In **Stage 3**, I implemented features such as storing offline form responses locally and submitting them when users get online, to make it a more complete PWA. 

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
